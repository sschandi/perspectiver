## Why

Perspective designs are used in many many mock-ups, previews, and headers to give images a bit more visual interest. However, when I searched for a tool to easily transform my precomiled images into a different perspective, I found nothing that could do what I wanted with minimal friction... so I decided to make my own. 

## Svelte

This project is made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a compile to JavaScript framework for building
user interfaces. Svelte's compile to JavaScript process allows it to skip using the virtual DOM entirely.
